        //System.out.println(x); Answer is 0.0

        //int x = (double) 8;
        //System.out.println(x); Answer is Syntax Error

        //int x = (int) 4.999 / (int) 2.5;

        //System.out.println(x); = Error double to int 
        
        //double x = 1 / 4
        //System.out.println(x); = 0.0 (Its possible because its int to double)
        
        //QUESTION 2
        //double y = (double) 1/3; 
        //System.out.println(y); (This is the solution.
